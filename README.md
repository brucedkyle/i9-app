# i9-app

This version of the I9 app includes the chat application and the backend AgenticAI for deployment to the cloud.

The intent of this app is to demonstrate a production-ready application end-to-end using Flask, React, OpenAI, and Pinecone and we’ll implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to give the LLM necessary context based on information it wasn’t trained on.
